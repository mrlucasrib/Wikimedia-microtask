    Each team must have a table with the following keys:
    code: A short code of 2-4 letters (uppercase) to represent the team.
    fullName: The full name of the team.
    shortName: The short name of the team, usually the location in which it is based.
    pageName: The title of the team's article on Wikipedia. This is usually the team's full name, but if disambiguation is
              needed, it may be different.
    startYear: The year in which the team first played.
    endYear: The year in which the team last played. (For inactive/disbanded/terminated teams only)
    
    This module is to be used with mw.loadData(). It should NOT contain functions!
